A userscript designed to brute force answers to Moodle PSETs

I made this when I was bored and stuck on one of my last PSETs of the year for one of my classes. 

This script will find the first text box on a Moodle-like URL and submit answers to it until it reaches the upper limit or the correct answer is found. It automatically starts when the requirements are met. Don't use this on penalty enabled questions or you will find yourself with a fully completed assignment and 0 points. 

I am providing it as is, I no longer use this script and you shouldn't either lest your exam grades suffer.
